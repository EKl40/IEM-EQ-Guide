# EQ for rough IEM emulation (\*)
So far, EQ was used to match an IEM's FR to a preference target (in most cases, HarmanIE 2019). It is also possible to roughly emulate another IEM through EQ. There are two methods to do so, both of which have already been covered previously: Squig AutoEQ and custom manual EQ. These will only yield rough approximations of another IEM.

Squig's AutoEQ implementation also allows for quick FR matching of one IEM's FR to another's. The steps are similar to using AutoEQ with targets.
Select your IEM model and the one you want to emulate in the Models tab, ensuring that only their FRs are on the graphs (with **no targets**). In the Equalizer tab, find the AutoEQ option, adjust the range (maximum upper limit around 10kHz as specified by the AutoEQ project), generate the preset, then export it accordingly.

1. Select the IEM to emulate in the Models tab
2. Select your IEM model in the Models tab, ensuring that only the two chosen IEM FRs are in the graph
3. In the Equalizer tab, select your model to EQ under the Parametric Equalizer section
4. Adjust the range (maximum upper limit around 10kHz as specified by the AutoEQ project)
5. Generate the preset by clicking on the AutoEQ button
6. Export the preset accordingly

The same can be achieved with creating a custom manual EQ preset as per the methodology outlined previously, and the same pros and cons apply. In both cases, the IEM FR that will emulated can simply be thought of as another target for which we're aiming for.
